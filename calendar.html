    <!--  defer mean stop
    In HTML, the defer attribute in the <script> tag ensures 
        that the script is executed after the HTML document has been 
        fully parsed, but before the DOMContentLoaded event.
 
       How defer works:
       Deferred Execution: The script is downloaded in parallel 
       while the HTML is being parsed, but its execution is deferred 
       until the document is fully parsed.
       Maintains Order: If there are multiple scripts with defer,
        they will be executed in the order they appear in the document.
        Doesnâ€™t Block Parsing: Unlike normal scripts, 
        which block the parsing of the HTML document
         until the script is executed, scripts with defer allow
          the HTML document to continue being processed 
          while the script is fetched. -->

          <!--it means the browser is reading and interpreting the HTML 
          code line by line to build the structure of the web page.

           Steps of Parsing:
           Reading the HTML file: The browser downloads the HTML file 
            from the server.
            Breaking it down into pieces (tokens): The browser starts breaking
            down the HTML into individual elements (tags, attributes, text, etc.).
           Building the DOM (Document Object Model): As the browser parses the HTML,
         it builds a structured tree called the DOM. The DOM is a representation 
          of the HTML document in a tree-like structure where each element 
         and attribute becomes a node.

Why Parsing is Important:
The browser needs to parse the HTML to understand the structure of the 
webpage, apply styles (CSS), and execute scripts (JavaScript).
 Parsing ensures that everything is correctly interpreted so 
 the webpage is rendered properly.  -->
